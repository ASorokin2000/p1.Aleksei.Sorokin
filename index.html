<h2> Part C </h2>
<h3> Issues with the current design </h3>
<p> 1) The current floor indicator is on a different panel than the buttons</p>
<p> 2) The floor sign and arrows are placed too high </p>
<p> 3) The Help button is too far to the floor buttons </p>
<h3> Pros of the design: </h3>
<p> The floor buttons follow the natural order of things </p>
<h3> Cons of the design: </h3>
<p> 1) Since the floor number and the direction arrows are too high, people don't look at them </p>
<p> 2) No one cleans them. So they are too dusty and barely visible. </p>
<p> 3) It's possible to accidentally push help button since it's too close to the floor buttons </p>
<h2> Part B </h2>
<h3> Common things that you use in elevator </h3>
  <p> 1) Floor Buttons </p>
  <p> 2) Open and Close the door Buttons </p>
  <p> 3) Looking at the floor number </p>
  <p> The current design makes it easy to find and push your floor button and maybe open the door for another person</p> 
  <p> However, it's almost impossible to know which floor you're on. I personally almost missed that top panel</p>
<h3> Rare things that you use in elevator </h3>
<p> 1) Help Button </p>
<p> 2) Emergency Button</p>
